Eye Tracking Model for Cheating Detection ðŸŽ¯ðŸ‘€

ðŸš€ A real-time eye-tracking system using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and a Machine Learning model to detect suspicious behavior based on eye movement. This project continuously improves itself by retraining on collected data.
ðŸ”¹ Features

âœ… Real-time eye tracking using MediaPipe Face Mesh
âœ… Calculates Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to analyze eye movement
âœ… Uses a pretrained Keras model (.keras) for cheating detection
âœ… Self-learning: Retrains on collected data for better accuracy
âœ… Supports CUDA acceleration (if available)
